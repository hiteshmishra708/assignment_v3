•	Present a working single page web interface which renders a multi-color bar chart (aka Horizontal Stacked Bar Chart)
•	The bar chart data should be based on a json response of a REST call to a backend using JQuery
•	The backend should be a Node.js server and the data returned by its REST interface should be coming from the attached sample file
•	The chart should be built using d3 and the multi colors should represent users using data element DE_ADDRESS over time. 
    For example, with the x axis representing timeline and y axis representing count, the most recent bar column should be a 
    total of 137 count of 11 different colors, each representing the different users (i.e. 6 for GERARD.ALLISON). 
    The 11th color represents all others which is 96.
•	The sample file contains additional data about such as DE_EMAIL and DE_DOB o which can be ignored
